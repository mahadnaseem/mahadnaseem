### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate data professional from Karachi with a Bachelor's degree in Computer & Information Systems Engineering from NED University. With hands-on experience in **Data Analytics, ETL Pipelines**, and **Machine Learning applications**, I love turning messy datasets into actionable insights and building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

I've worked with clients from Pakistan to the US, helping optimize inventory, visualize marketing performance, and create AI-driven solutions — including chatbots and prediction tools.
